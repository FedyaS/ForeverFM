I've lost count of how many times I've walked into a studio or a home recording space and thought, \"Okay, this is going to be a long day.\" One particular instance that comes to mind is when I was working with a singer-songwriter who had just converted her garage into a recording studio. She had a great ear for music, but the room was basically a giant echo chamber. The first thing I noticed was that every time she sang, her voice would just bounce off the walls and create this crazy amount of reverberation. It was like the room was singing along with her, but not in a good way."

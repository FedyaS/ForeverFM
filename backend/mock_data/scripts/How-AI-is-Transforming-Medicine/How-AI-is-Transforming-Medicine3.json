    "text": "I've spoken to a cardiologist who's using AI to analyze ECGs, and the results are astonishing. She shared a story about a patient who was misdiagnosed with a minor condition, but the AI algorithm flagged it as a potential heart attack. The doctor re-examined the patient, and sure enough, it was a heart attack. The AI's intervention likely saved the patient's life. What's striking is how AI is not only augmenting human capabilities but also fostering a new level of collaboration between doctors and machines. It's no longer about replacing human intuition but about amplifying it with data-driven insights. I'd love to explore more examples like this and discuss the potential for AI to redefine the role of medical professionals in the future."

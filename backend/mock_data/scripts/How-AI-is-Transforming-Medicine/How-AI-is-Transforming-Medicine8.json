I've heard about AI-powered chatbots that can detect early signs of anxiety and depression in patients, and offer tailored guidance and resources. This could be a game-changer for mental health support, especially in underserved communities. I'd love to explore more examples of AI-powered patient engagement platforms that are focusing on mental health and wellness. What are your thoughts on how we can ensure these platforms are not only informative, but also compassionate and empathetic?"

I'd like to take it a step further and explore how this transparency can also empower patients to take a more active role in their healthcare. Imagine being able to access a personalized dashboard that breaks down your diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis in a clear and concise manner. This could be a game-changer for patient engagement and shared decision-making. By demystifying the AI-driven insights, we can create a more informed and collaborative approach to healthcare. What are your thoughts on how we can design these patient-facing interfaces to be both intuitive and informative, and what role do you see AI playing in the future of patient empowerment?"

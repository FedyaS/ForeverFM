It raises an interesting question: how do we ensure that AI systems are transparent and explainable, so doctors can understand the reasoning behind their recommendations? I'd love to explore the concept of 'explainable AI' in medicine, and how it can build trust between humans and machines. Perhaps we can discuss some of the latest research in this area, and how it's being applied in real-world clinical settings. This could be a game-changer for patient care, and I'm excited to dive deeper into the possibilities. What are your thoughts on how we can strike the right balance between AI-driven insights and human intuition in medical decision-making?"

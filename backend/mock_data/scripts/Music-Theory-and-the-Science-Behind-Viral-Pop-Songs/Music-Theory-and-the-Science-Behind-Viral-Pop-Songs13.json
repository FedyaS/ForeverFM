It's like we're living in a never-ending remix, where the past, present, and future are constantly being recombined. I love how you brought up the role of social media and streaming platforms \u2013 it's like they're creating a new kind of sonic ecosystem, where songs can evolve and adapt in real-time. As we wrap up this conversation, I'm left wondering: what's the next big mutation in the music landscape? What unexpected fusion of sounds, styles, and technologies will give birth to the next viral phenomenon? The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to see where the conversation takes us next."

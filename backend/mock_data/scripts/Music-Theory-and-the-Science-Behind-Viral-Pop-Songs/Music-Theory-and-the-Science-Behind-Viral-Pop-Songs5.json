It's almost like the production is a character in itself, adding another layer of emotional depth. I think that's what makes it so interesting \u2013 when the production and melody work together in harmony, it's like a one-two punch for the listener's emotions. I'd love to explore more examples of how production can elevate the emotional impact of a song. Maybe we can dive into some cases where the production is more maximalist, like a Daft Punk or Kanye West track, and see how they use those bigger, bolder sounds to create a sense of anthemic urgency."

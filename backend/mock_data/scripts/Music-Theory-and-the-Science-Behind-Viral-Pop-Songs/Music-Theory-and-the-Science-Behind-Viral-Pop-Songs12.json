This curatorial approach can be incredibly powerful in creating a sense of shared experience and community. I think it's also worth exploring how social media and streaming platforms have changed the way we consume and interact with music. With playlists and algorithms, songs can now reach a massive audience in a matter of hours. How do you think this shift has impacted the way artists approach songwriting and production, especially when it comes to creating viral hits?"

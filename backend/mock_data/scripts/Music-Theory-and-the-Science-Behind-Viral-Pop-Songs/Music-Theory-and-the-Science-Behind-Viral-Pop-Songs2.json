I think it's also worth exploring the role of emotional connection in making a song go viral. When a melody or lyric resonates with us on a deeper level, it can create a sense of ownership and make us more likely to share it with others. I'd love to examine some case studies of viral pop songs and see if we can pinpoint the exact moments where the combination of melody, twist, and emotional connection come together to create a truly unforgettable listening experience. What are your thoughts on how artists balance this emotional resonance with the need for a catchy, repeatable hook?"

They weave in relatable themes and emotions, but also leave enough space for listeners to fill in the gaps with their own experiences. This is where the psychology of songwriting comes in \u2013 it's almost like a gentle suggestion, rather than a explicit statement. Take a song like Lorde's 'Royals', for example. The melody is undeniably catchy, but it's the lyrics that tap into a sense of universal longing and disillusionment. The combination is pure gold, and it's what makes the song so memorable and shareable."

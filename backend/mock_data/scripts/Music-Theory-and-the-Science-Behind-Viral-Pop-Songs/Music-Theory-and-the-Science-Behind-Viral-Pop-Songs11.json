I think this nostalgia-innovation balance also speaks to the idea of cultural currency, where artists are able to tap into the collective memory of a genre and update it for a new audience. It's like they're curating a sonic museum, where the past and present coexist in a single track. I'd love to explore how this curatorial approach affects the listener's emotional response, and how it contributes to a song's viral potential. Perhaps we can look at examples like Kendrick Lamar's 'Alright', where the nostalgic sample is recontextualized to create a powerful anthem for a new generation."

I think that's where mentorship and community come in - having a support network that can offer guidance and share experiences can be incredibly valuable. I've seen startups that have leveraged accelerators, incubators, or even just informal networks of fellow founders to get feedback and advice, and it's made all the difference. It's almost like having a 'startup sandbox' where they can experiment, take risks, and learn from their mistakes without fear of failure. What are your thoughts on how we can encourage more of this kind of collaborative mindset in the startup ecosystem?"

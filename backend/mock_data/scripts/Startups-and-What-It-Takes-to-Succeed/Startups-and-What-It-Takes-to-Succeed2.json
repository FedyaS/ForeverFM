One aspect that I think is often overlooked, but is crucial to a startup's success, is adaptability. The ability to pivot when necessary, to adjust to changing market conditions or customer needs, can be a major differentiator. I'd love to explore some examples of startups that have successfully navigated these kinds of challenges. Perhaps we can also discuss the role of mentorship and community in helping founders develop this adaptability muscle. What are your thoughts on that, Chip?"

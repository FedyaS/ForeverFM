I'd like to take it a step further by exploring the role of 'ecosystem orchestrators' \u2013 individuals or organizations that facilitate these collaborative relationships. Perhaps we can look at platforms like Startup Genome or the Global Accelerator Network, which bring together founders, investors, and experts to drive innovation. These orchestrators can help identify areas where co-opetition can thrive, providing the necessary infrastructure and support for startups to collaborate and grow. By examining their strategies, we might uncover valuable insights on how to foster a culture of co-opetition in the startup ecosystem."

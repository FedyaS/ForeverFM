We're still live, because, well, that's just what we do here on ForeverFM - 24/7, no breaks, no sleep. I mean, who needs sleep when you're talking about the latest innovations, right? Chip's been researching some fascinating startup cases, and I'm sure he'll have some insightful thoughts to share. As we delve into the startup scene, I want to hear from our audience - what makes a startup truly thrive? Is it the idea, the team, or something else entirely? Let's get the conversation started, and who knows, maybe we'll inspire the next big thing."

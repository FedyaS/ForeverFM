By sharing research and resources, they've been able to drive down costs and accelerate innovation, ultimately benefiting the entire industry. It's a win-win situation. I'd love to explore more cases like this, where collaboration has led to breakthroughs. Perhaps we could also discuss the role of facilitators or catalysts in bringing these collaborative relationships to life. Are there certain individuals, organizations, or platforms that can help foster co-opetition and drive growth in the startup ecosystem?"

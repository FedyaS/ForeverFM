Imagine a shared resource pool, where founders can tap into each other's expertise and experiences. It's not just about mentorship, but about co-creating solutions that benefit the entire ecosystem. I'd love to explore some examples of startups that have successfully collaborated with their competitors, and how that's led to innovation and growth. Perhaps we can also discuss the role of events, conferences, and online platforms in facilitating these connections and fostering a sense of community. What are your thoughts on how we can facilitate more of these collaborative relationships in the startup space?"

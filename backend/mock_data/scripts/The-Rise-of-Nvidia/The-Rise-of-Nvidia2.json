They're not just relying on in-house innovation, but also collaborating with other industry leaders to drive progress. For example, their work with companies like Mercedes-Benz on autonomous vehicles is really pushing the boundaries of what's possible. And it's not just about the tech itself, but also about creating new business models and revenue streams. I mean, who would have thought that a graphics card company would be at the forefront of the autonomous vehicle revolution? It just goes to show that in today's fast-paced tech landscape, the lines between industries are blurring, and the most innovative companies are the ones that are willing to think outside the box."

It's no longer just about the big players; it's about empowering the grassroots innovators, the ones who can identify real-world problems and create solutions that are tailored to specific needs. I think Nvidia's role in this ecosystem is not just about providing the tools, but also about fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing. We're seeing the emergence of a new breed of innovators who are not just tech-savvy, but also domain experts, and that's where the magic happens. It's an exciting time, and I think we're on the cusp of seeing some truly groundbreaking applications that will change the way we live and work."

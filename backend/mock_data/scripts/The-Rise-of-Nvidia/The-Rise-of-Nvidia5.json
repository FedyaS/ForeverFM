With the power of AI and machine learning at their fingertips, startups and entrepreneurs can now challenge established players in fields like healthcare, finance, and education. It's not just about creating new products, but about reimagining entire business models and customer experiences. The potential for innovation is staggering, and I think we're just beginning to scratch the surface of what's possible. As we move forward, it'll be fascinating to see how Nvidia continues to empower these innovators and shapes the future of various industries."

Speaking of immersion, I've found that staying in eco-lodges or family-run guesthouses can be a fantastic way to connect with the community. Not only do you get to support local economies, but you also get to taste homemade cuisine and hear stories from the hosts themselves. It's a more intimate way to experience the Peruvian way of life, and it can lead to some incredible, off-the-beaten-path adventures. I recall staying at a small lodge in the Amazon, where the owner took me on a guided hike to a secret waterfall \u2013 it was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience."

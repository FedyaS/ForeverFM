One of them is the town of Mancora, a coastal gem that's often overlooked by travelers flocking to Lima or Cusco. The laid-back surfer vibe, stunning beaches, and incredible seafood make it a perfect spot to unwind and soak up the Peruvian sun. And for adventure-seekers, the nearby Huacas del Sol y la Luna are a must-visit \u2013 these ancient temples are a window into the region's rich history and mythology. It's experiences like these that make traveling to Peru so unique and unforgettable."

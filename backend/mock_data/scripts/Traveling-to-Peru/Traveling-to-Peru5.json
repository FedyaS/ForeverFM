For example, the Fiesta de la Vendimia in Mendoza is a great time to experience the local wine culture, while the Inti Raymi festival in Cusco is a fascinating glimpse into the ancient Inca traditions. These events offer a chance to connect with the locals and truly immerse yourself in the culture. And, as a traveler, being able to participate in these authentic experiences is what makes Peru so special \u2013 it's not just about visiting a place, but about becoming a part of it, even if only for a moment."

I think that's what makes travel so enriching, don't you? The way we can experience the history, traditions, and values of a place through its people and landscapes. I've had some incredible encounters with local guides and villagers in the mountains, and it's amazing how their stories and perspectives can deepen our appreciation for the land. The Alpine clubs in the Dolomites are a great example of this, and I'd love to explore more of these human stories behind the trails and peaks we hike and climb. It's not just about the summit; it's about the people and cultures that shape our journey."

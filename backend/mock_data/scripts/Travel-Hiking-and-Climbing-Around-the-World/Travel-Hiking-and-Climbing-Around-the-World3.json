But what I'm really curious about is the cultural aspect of these destinations. How do the local communities perceive and interact with these natural wonders? I've heard that in the Dolomites, for example, the via ferrata routes are often maintained by local Alpine clubs, which adds a rich layer of history and tradition to the experience. I'd love to explore more of these cultural connections and how they enrich our travels. What are your thoughts on that, Chip?"

And the best part is, we're just getting started... literally, since we're always live, 24/7. I guess you could say we're on a never-ending journey here on ForeverFM. Aaliyah's been itching to dive into this topic, and I'm excited to see where she'll take us. From the Himalayas to the Rockies, there are so many incredible destinations to explore. So, buckle up, folks, and let's start planning our next virtual adventure. Aaliyah, what's on your mind - are we summiting Everest or hiking through the Grand Canyon?"

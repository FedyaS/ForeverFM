It's amazing how much of a difference it can make when you get it right. One thing that I've been experimenting with lately is using a combination of absorption and diffusion to create a sense of \"air\" in a room. You know, that sense of space and distance that makes a recording sound like it was made in a big, expensive studio. I've been using a technique called \"atmospheric treatment\" which involves placing diffusion products in strategic locations to create a sense of ambiance and atmosphere. It's really cool because it can make a small room sound like a big one, and it can even help to create a sense of depth and dimensionality in a mix. I've been using a combination of quadratic residue diffusers and MLS diffusers, along with some absorption panels, to create a sense of \"space\" in a room. And it's been really interesting to see how it affects the way I work and the music I make. For example, I was working on a mix recently and I added some diffusion to the room, and suddenly the whole mix just opened up and sounded more expansive and detailed. It was like I had added a whole new dimension to the music. And it's not just about the technical aspects of it, it's also about the psychological impact it has on the creative process. When you're working in a room that sounds great and feels inspiring, you're more likely to take risks and try new things, which can lead to some really amazing and unexpected results. I'd love to explore this idea further and hear more about your experiences with atmospheric treatment and diffusion in the studio. But for now, I think it's time for us to take a quick break. We'll be back with more on acoustic treatment and music production after this short break. Stay tuned."

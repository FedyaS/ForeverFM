But you know it's all part of the process and its amazing how much of a difference it can make. I think we have covered that topic pretty well, and it is a great reminder for all of our listeners out there trying to set up their own studios. Okay so let's move onto something new. Now we've got a message from one of our listeners User 573 who says 'I am a big fan, can you talk about internships in technology?' Ah, great topic. You know internships are such a fanastic way to get your foot in the door especially in the tech industry. I mean think about it: it's a chance to get hands on experience, make connections, and learn from people who are already doing what you want to do. And lets be real, it's also a great way to figure out if a particular field is really for you. So lets dive into it. What are some things that our listeners should be looking for an internship in technology, what are some red flags to watch out for, and most importantly how can you make the most out of an internship to set yourself up for success in the long run."
